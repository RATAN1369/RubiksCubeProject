# Rubik's Cube Project

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
The **Rubik's Cube Project** is an implementation of a Rubik's Cube simulator and solver.  
It allows users to:
- Represent and manipulate a Rubikâ€™s Cube in code.
- Perform rotations and moves on the cube.
- Apply solving algorithms to reach the solved state.
- (Planned) Integrate with **OpenCV** to scan real cube colors using a webcam and feed them into the solver.

This project is designed to help understand cube notations, state representations, and solving techniques while also serving as a base for real-world Rubikâ€™s Cube solving automation.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Cube representation (3D state stored in code).
- Basic moves and rotations (R, L, U, D, F, B with variants).
- Scramble generation.
- Solver module (work in progress).
- Planned integration with **OpenCV** for webcam cube scanning.
